**User requests:**
Create a nextjs and react app that allows me to create rotations. I should be able to edit the people in the rotation and move the rotation forward or backward. It should show me all rotations, who is the current person active in the rotation, the other members of the rotation etc. It should all be persistent, people that are in the rotation and who is active in the rotation. Add all of the files needed to deploy that app, like package.json
- Ok, i need the ability of creating multiple rotations and when I refresh the website it should show the person that was active instead of resetting back to the first person that was added
- add the ability to have multiple rotations

Check OUTPUT.md for the complete unaltered output.

## Project Plan
```
### Project Plan for Next.js & React Rotation Management App

#### **1. Project Initialization**
- **Task 1**: Initialize a new Next.js project.
  - Use command: `npx create-next-app@latest rotation-app`
  - Navigate to project directory: `cd rotation-app`

#### **2. Component Creation**
- **Task 2**: Set up components for rotation management.
  - **RotationInput Component**: 
    - Form for adding/removing/editing people.
    - Propagate these actions back to state management.
  - **RotationList Component**: 
    - Display all rotations and the current active person.
    - Show other members of the rotation.
  - **RotationManager Component**:
    - Handle the logic for moving rotations forward/backward.
    - Manage state updates for the active person in rotation.

#### **3. State Management and Persistence**
- **Task 3**: Choose a state management approach.
  - Use `useState` for temporary local state.
  - Use `localStorage` for persistent data across sessions.
 consider React Context API or a state management library like Redux if scalability is necessary.

#### **4. Rotation Management Logic**
- **Task 4**: Develop core functions for managing rotation data.
  - CRUD operations for rotation members.
  - Functions to shift rotations based on the need.
  - Update the active person in the rotation.

#### **5. Implement UI**
- **Task 5**: Implement the user interface as designed.
  - Refine forms and controls in `RotationInput`.
  - Design and implement displaying elements in `RotationList` and `RotationManager`.
  - Optimize components for responsiveness and reusability.

#### **6. End-to-End Testing**
- **Task 6**: Write tests to ensure functionality works as intended.
  - Unit testing for components and logic.
  - Integration tests for the flow of data between components.
  - UI tests for visual aspects.

#### **7. Deployment Preparation**
- **Task 7**: Prepare the app for deployment.
  - Create `production` files (e.g., `build`).
  - Ensure `package.json` includes all necessary scripts and dependencies.
  - Configure `next.config.js` if custom configurations are needed.

#### **8. Deployment**
- **Task 8**: Deploy the app using a service.
  - Use Vercel or Netlify for hosting.
  - Ensure all DNS settings and environment variables are correctly configured.

### **Technical Considerations:**
- **Data Storage**:
  - **Local Storage**: Simple and easy to implement for small datasets.
  - **Databases**: Use for larger datasets or to avoid client-side limitations.
  
- **State Management**:
  - **Context API/Redux**: Choose based on complexity and scalability.
  
- **CSS Framework**:
  - Tailwind CSS has been included but can be replaced with other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or styled-components for different styling needs.

- **Performance**:
  - Optimize components for re-renders and memoization.
  - Use Next.js optimizations out of the box (e.g., static generation, server-side rendering).

This roadmap ensures that every essential aspect of your project is covered, leading to a robust and efficient rotation management application.
